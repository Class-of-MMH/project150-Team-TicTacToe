Ball catching game

# Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Ball recieving" project developed as part of the Project Work 1 course (CSE 150). The game is implemented in C++ and designed to run as a console application on a computer. Also here is a C language version. We have used our knowlegde related array, loop, sorting etc .

# Game Description
The "Ball recieving" is a classic game where players control a player on a linear way, moving te player's avatar to catch randomly dropping balls. the ball changes it's direction randomly while falling, but in last two moves it does not, which helps the player to decide how to catch it. As the player catches the ball, it adds point, presenting a challenge to the player. The main goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting balls without missing any. and even if the player misses, there are 3 lifelines as more chances. there are three levels- easy, midium and hard to make it way more challanging.
# Controls
write for right: r or for left: l  and n- neutral- for controlling the player's direction. The player can replay, means can play the same level but a new afresh start. Here we also added restart where the player can change the level of the game. Also the player can exit the game whenever wants.
# Obstacle
The primary obstacle in the game is the ball touching the ground. It leads to the life loss and ultimately end of the game.

# Development Goals
The key development goals include implementing essential game features such as user input handling, random ball generation, player movement mechanics, missing the ball detection, and a scoring system. The project emphasizes the use of fundamental programming concepts and relevant data structures.

# Learning Outcomes
Fundamental Programming Concepts: Gain a deeper understanding and application of fundamental programming concepts in a real-world project setting.

Problem-Solving Skills: Develop problem-solving skills through the challenges of game development, including handling user input and designing game mechanics.

User Input Handling and Game Mechanics: Acquire experience in handling user input and implementing core game mechanics for an interactive and engaging user experience.

Algorithm Implementation: Implement basic algorithms for collision detection and score tracking, enhancing algorithmic thinking skills.

Teamwork and Collaboration: Enhance teamwork and collaboration skills through group project work as part of Team tictactoe.
