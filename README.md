Ball catching game

# Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Ball recieving" project developed as part of the Project Work 1 course (CSE 150). The game is implemented in C++ and designed to run as a console application on a computer.

# Game Description
The "Ball recieving" is a classic game where players control a player on a linear way, moving te player's avatar to catch randomly dropping balls. As the player catches the ball, it adds point, presenting a challenge to the player. The main goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting balls without missing any.
# Controls
write for right: r or for left: l - for controlling the player's direction.
# Obstacle
The primary obstacle in the game is the ball touching the ground. It leads to the end of the game.

# Development Goals
The key development goals include implementing essential game features such as user input handling, random food generation, player movement mechanics, missing the ball detection, and a scoring system. The project emphasizes the use of fundamental programming concepts and relevant data structures.

# Learning Outcomes
Fundamental Programming Concepts: Gain a deeper understanding and application of fundamental programming concepts in a real-world project setting.

Problem-Solving Skills: Develop problem-solving skills through the challenges of game development, including handling user input and designing game mechanics.

User Input Handling and Game Mechanics: Acquire experience in handling user input and implementing core game mechanics for an interactive and engaging user experience.

Algorithm Implementation: Implement basic algorithms for collision detection and score tracking, enhancing algorithmic thinking skills.

Teamwork and Collaboration: Enhance teamwork and collaboration skills through group project work as part of Team tictactoe.
